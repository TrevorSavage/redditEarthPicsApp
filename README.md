"Reddit Picture Finder"

created by Trevor Savage

A simple python script to fetch images from a specified subreddit page and download them to a file on your computer. 
I made this for fun and practice. Feel free to check it out and use it if you want to.

NOTE: I removed the client id and client secret that I obtained via registering the app with reddit. 
If you want to use this app yourself, you will need to obtain your own id and secret from reddit.
